# alien-game-challenge

This game is very simple but shows off some useful skills. When the attacking button is pressed, one of the aliens looses a set amount of health but on a randomised basis. 
Once each of the aliens looses all their health, they are then dead and will no longer loose health. If the Mothership is killed then all of the aliens will die immediately.
Only very simple styling used.
